# Open Source Governance Model @ Bullhorn

## Mission Statement

Bullhorn is constantly developing and using new technologies to solve the problems of our users. Sometimes we find and use great open source technologies that solve a problem we are having and other times we make some great technologies for problems that haven’t been solved yet.

## Governance Committee

The governance committee consists of those individuals identified as ‘project owners’ within the organization. To ensure the smooth running of projects, the committee has responsibilities over and above those of a contributor. Committee members are expected to review code contributions, participate in strategic planning, approve changes to the governance model.

Members consist of champions of the our projects and while they do not have significant authority over other members of other projects they are involved in the discussion and steering of the projects.  They will also appoint the new champions for new projects or replace champions of existing project if the need arises.

## Champions

A single champion will be appointed for each project maintained by Bullhorn by the Governance Committee.  The champion will act as the project owner for the project and  in addition to their actions as contributors, champions may also find themselves doing one or more of the following:
providing roadmap and feature updates

* Identifying requirements
* Supporting new users
* Triaging bugs
* Review, accept/reject pull requests
* Assisting with project infrastructure

## Collaborators

Several collaborators will be associated with each project, these members trusted contributors that share several responsibilities with the champions.  The will be involved with the roadmap discussion and act as a sounding board for the champion.  They will act as the champion when the champion is unavailable and  in addition to their actions as contributors, collaborators may also find themselves doing one or more of the following:

* Identifying requirements
* Supporting new users
* Triaging bugs
* Review, accept/reject pull requests
* Assisting with project infrastructure

## Contributors

Contributors are any members who contribute in concrete ways to the project. Anyone can become a contributor, and contributions can take many form, most will find themselves doing one or more of the following:

* Reporting bugs
* Writing documentation
* Rixing bugs
* Adding features

Contributors engage with the project through the issue tracker or by writing or editing documentation. They submit changes to the project itself via pull requests which will be considered for inclusion in the project by existing the project’s champion.

## Support & Evangelism

We will have “Users” which are community members who have a need for the project. They are the most important members of the projects and without them the project would have no purpose.

Everyone is encouraged to provide support for new users. This support is provided as a way of growing the community. We recognize that all support activity within the project is voluntary and is therefore provided as and when time allows.

Getting users to learn about our projects and ultimately use them is important.  It is the reason we open the projects in the first place.  Everyone is encouraged to link to these resources, write blog post, tweet, etc…

## Contribution Process

Anyone can contribute to the project whether they are within the organization or not.  For feature implementation or bug fixes all contributions will need to come in the form of a pull request.  All Bullhorn project will share the same pull request template.  The pull request will be reviewed and approved by the project’s champion.  

There are other ways to contribute to the project, such as logging issues, adding feature requests, provide help of feedback on other issues.  All Bullhorn projects will also share a issue template.

## Decision Making

Decisions about the future of the project are made through discussion with all members of the project.  This will be in the form of github issues for feature request, roadmap items, and bugs.  Discussions will happen through this medium, then will be discussed with the governance committee but in the end the final say is controlled by the champion for each project.  This will ensure that the project is not bogged down by endless discussion.
